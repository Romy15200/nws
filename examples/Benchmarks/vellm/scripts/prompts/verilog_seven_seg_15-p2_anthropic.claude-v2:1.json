    "prompt": "\"**Task:**  \\nYou are an expert in formal hardware verification. Your task is to analyze a SystemVerilog hardware module and a hard-to-verify property. \\nThen, suggest intermediate lemmas that could simplify the verification process in Jasper by breaking down the complex property into smaller, verifiable parts.\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. **Understand the Module:** Analyze the provided SystemVerilog module to grasp its functionality, focusing on relevant state transitions, signal interactions, and critical behaviors.\\n2. **Analyze the Hard Property:** Break down the given property into smaller logical components. Identify why it might be hard for Jasper to verify (e.g., complex dependencies, wide state space, non-trivial data paths).\\n3. **Identify Invariants and Behaviors:** Think about invariants or simple behaviors that must always hold true and could serve as intermediate lemmas.\\n4. **Generate Lemmas:** Propose lemmas that are easier to prove and, when assumed, help Jasper verify the hard property.\\n5. **Explain the Reasoning:** For each lemma, explain why it is relevant and how it simplifies the verification.\\n6. **JSON block:** Your response must contain a JSON block with the suggested lemmas. The JSON block must be formatted exactly as shown below, and be enclosed in triple backticks.\\n###  Example Format:\\n```JSON\\n{\\n   \\\"lemmas\\\": [\\n       {\\n           \\\"lemma_index\\\": \\\"SystemVerilog assertion\\\"\\n       }\\n   ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor example, for the following verilog module:\\nmodule PWM_TOP (input clk, input [3:0] sw, output reg pulse_red);\\n\\n  localparam CBITS = 21;    // Change pulse_wideR accordingly\\n\\n  wire [CBITS-1:0] pulse_wideR;\\n  assign pulse_wideR = {1'b0, sw[3:1], 17'd0};     // (CBTIS-4)\\n\\n  reg [CBITS-1:0] cnt_R;\\n\\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\\n    cnt_R <= cnt_R + 1;\\n\\n    if (cnt_R < pulse_wideR)\\n      pulse_red = 1'b1;\\n    else\\n      pulse_red = 1'b0;\\n\\n  end\\n\\np1: assert property  (@(posedge clk) (always s_eventually pulse_red == 0)) ; \\nendmodule\\n\\nYou may want to propose the following lemmas:\\n1. assume property (@(posedge clk) (pulse_wideR < 2**20));\\n2. assume property (@(posedge clk) (always s_eventually cnt_R == 2**20));\\n\\nexplain the reasoning behind choosing these lemmas, and end your response with:\\n```JSON\\n{\\n   \\\"lemmas\\\": [\\n       {\\n           \\\"lemma_1\\\": \\\"assume property (@(posedge clk) (pulse_wideR < 2**20));\\\"\\n       },\\n       {\\n           \\\"lemma_2\\\": \\\"assume property (@(posedge clk) (always s_eventually cnt_R == 2**20));\\\"\\n       }\\n   ]\\n}\\n\\n**Your Turn:**  \\nAnalyze the provided module and property.
